# Operators-in-C++
## Aim: This experiment provides an overview of the various operators available in C++ programming. 
## Theory:
 Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
 Types of Operators: 
### 1. Arithmetic Operators
Perform basic mathematical operations:

1. + (Addition): a + b
2. - (Subtraction): a - b
3. * (Multiplication): a * b
4. / (Division): a / b
5. % (Modulus): a % b (remainder of division)

#### 2. Relational Operators
Compare two values:
 
1. == (Equal to): a == b
2. != (Not equal to): a != b
3. > (Greater than): a > b
4. < (Less than): a < b
5. >= (Greater than or equal to): a >= b
6. <= (Less than or equal to): a <= b

#### 3. Logical Operators
Combine multiple boolean expressions:

1. && (Logical AND): a && b
2. || (Logical OR): a || b
3. ! (Logical NOT): !a

### 4. Assignment Operators
Assign values to variables:

1. = (Simple assignment): a = b
2. += (Add and assign): a += b
3. -= (Subtract and assign): a -= b
4. *= (Multiply and assign): a *= b
5. /= (Divide and assign): a /= b
6. %= (Modulus and assign): a %= b

### 5. Increment and Decrement Operators
Increase or decrease a value by one:

1. ++ (Increment): ++a or a++
2. -- (Decrement): --a or a--
